# Security Compliance Context Initializer
## imx93-jaguar-eink Board Security Assessment Framework

**Purpose**: This document serves as the context initializer for generating security compliance reports for the imx93-jaguar-eink board. It provides the framework and methodology for conducting periodic security assessments against UK CE RED and EU CRA requirements.

**Target Audience**: Technical Leadership and C-Suite  
**Update Frequency**: Updated as requirements or implementation changes  
**Report Generation**: Use this context to generate versioned security reports

## Assessment Framework

### Device Overview
- **Board**: imx93-jaguar-eink E-Ink Signage Board  
- **SoC**: NXP i.MX93 with EdgeLock Enclave (ELE)
- **Platform**: Foundries.io Linux Micro Platform v95 (Scarthgap)  
- **BSP**: meta-dynamicdevices custom layer
- **Use Case**: Battery-powered E-Ink signage device (5+ year battery life target)

### Regulatory Framework
1. **UK CE RED (Radio Equipment Directive)**
   - Health and Safety Protection
   - Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
   - Efficient Use of Radio Spectrum
   - Network Security (Article 3.3(d))

2. **EU CRA (Cyber Resilience Act)**
   - Security by Design
   - Security by Default
   - Vulnerability Management
   - Secure Updates
   - Incident Response
   - Data Protection
   - Supply Chain Security

### Assessment Methodology

#### Confidence Levels
- **HIGH**: Implemented, tested, and verified
- **MEDIUM**: Implemented but testing pending or partial
- **LOW**: To be implemented or significant gaps identified

#### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**: Full compliance with high confidence
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: Feature implemented but testing pending
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**: Some aspects implemented, gaps identified
- ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Requirement not yet addressed
- üî∂ **NOT RELEVANT**: Requirement doesn't apply to this board design

### Root of Trust and Security Architecture

#### Hardware Security Foundation
- **Primary Root of Trust**: NXP i.MX93 EdgeLock Enclave (ELE)
- **Hardware Security Module**: Dedicated Cortex-M33 security co-processor
- **Boot ROM**: Immutable ROM code establishing initial root of trust
- **AHAB**: Advanced High Assurance Boot for i.MX93

#### Complete Secure Boot Chain
```
ROM Boot ‚Üí AHAB ‚Üí U-Boot SPL ‚Üí U-Boot ‚Üí OP-TEE ‚Üí Linux Kernel
```

#### Component Signing Framework
- **U-Boot SPL**: RSA-2048/ECDSA P-256 signatures validated by AHAB
- **U-Boot**: FIT image signing with factory keys
- **TF-A**: ECDSA P-256 signing
- **OP-TEE**: Trusted Application signing capability
- **Kernel**: FIT image signing with module signature verification
- **PMU (MCXC143VFM)**: MCUboot with RSA-2048 verification

#### Key Management Structure
- **Development Builds**: Signing disabled for speed
- **Production Builds**: Factory keys stored in Foundries.io infrastructure
- **Key Storage**: `${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/` directory structure
- **eFuse Programming**: Production devices require AHAB key hash programming

### Testing and Verification Areas

#### Security Subsystem Verification
- EdgeLock Enclave functionality
- OP-TEE Trusted Execution Environment
- Hardware crypto acceleration
- Secure storage capabilities

#### Network Security Assessment
- Firewall configuration (iptables)
- SSH service security
- WiFi security (WPA3 support)
- Attack surface analysis

#### OTA Security Verification
- OSTree signature verification
- TUF (The Update Framework) implementation
- Foundries.io OTA security
- Rollback protection

#### Physical Security Assessment
- Secure boot verification
- Debug interface security
- Tamper detection capabilities

### Report Generation Guidelines

#### Versioning Format
- **File Name**: `SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_REPORT_YYYY-MM-DD_[GIT-HASH].md`
- **Version**: Date-based with git commit reference
- **BSP Version**: Link to specific meta-dynamicdevices commit

#### Report Sections
1. **Executive Summary** - High-level compliance status
2. **Root of Trust Analysis** - Complete security architecture
3. **Regulatory Compliance Assessment** - UK CE RED and EU CRA mapping
4. **Security Verification Status** - Implementation and testing status
5. **Risk Assessment** - Identified risks and mitigation status
6. **Recommendations** - Immediate, short-term, and long-term actions
7. **Compliance Status Matrix** - Tabular summary with confidence levels

#### Update Triggers
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Regular assessment updates
- **Major BSP Changes**: Significant security-related changes
- **Regulatory Updates**: Changes to UK CE RED or EU CRA requirements
- **Security Incidents**: Following any security-related events
- **Pre-Production**: Before production deployment
