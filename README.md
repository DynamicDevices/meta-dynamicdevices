## üìã Quick Start - Get Running in Minutes

> **üöÄ Ready to Go**: All boards come with pre-built production images and comprehensive programming packages for immediate deployment.

### ‚ö° **Zero to Running Board in 4 Steps**

#### **Step 1: Download Programming Package** üì¶
```bash
# Visit our CI builds and download the latest programming package for your board
# https://github.com/DynamicDevices/meta-dynamicdevices/actions/workflows/kas-build-ci.yml
# Download: programming-package-[your-board-name].zip
```

#### **Step 2: Setup Board for Programming** üîå
```bash
# 1. Power OFF your board
# 2. Set DIP switches to download/recovery mode (see board manual)
# 3. Connect USB cable between board and your computer
# 4. Power ON your board
```

#### **Step 3: Program Your Board** ‚ö°
```bash
# Extract the programming package
unzip programming-package-imx8mm-jaguar-sentai.zip  # (or your board)
cd programming-package-imx8mm-jaguar-sentai/

# The programming package includes the correct UUU tool version
# NO need to install system UUU - use the included one for compatibility

# Program the board (takes ~3-5 minutes)
./program-imx8mm-jaguar-sentai.sh --flash
```

#### **Step 4: First Boot** üéâ
```bash
# 1. Set DIP switches back to normal boot mode
# 2. Power cycle the board
# 3. Board boots to login prompt (user: root, no password)
# 4. Connect Ethernet or setup WiFi
# 5. Start developing immediately!

# Verify everything works
docker --version      # Docker ready for containers
iwconfig              # WiFi available  
systemctl status       # All services running
```

### üéØ **What You Get Out-of-the-Box**
- **Full Linux System**: Yocto-based embedded Linux with all drivers
- **Container Runtime**: Docker pre-installed for application deployment
- **Networking**: WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet configured and ready
