An on-chip, low-latency DSP supports Texas
Instruments SmartAmp speaker protection algorithms.
The integrated current and voltage sense provides
for real-time monitoring of the loudspeakers, which
permits pushing peak sound pressure levels (SPL)
while keeping speakers from being damaged.
The integrated look-ahead Class-H boost dynamically
adjusts boost voltage during playback, increasing
efficiency and saving battery life in battery-powered
systems. For regulated wall-powered systems,
TAS2563 also features a boost bypass mode,
supporting supply voltages of up to 16V for even
higher output power.
Two PDM microphone inputs simplify the audio
signal chain for two-way audio systems, interfacing
digital microphones with the host processor. A batterytracking peak voltage limiter with brown-out protection
prevents systems shutdowns by optimizing amplifier
headroom over the entire charge cycle.

All typical characteristics for the devices are measured using the Bench EVM and an Audio Precision SYS-2722
Audio Analyzer. A PSIA interface is used to allow the I2S interface to be driven directly into the SYS-2722.
Speaker output terminals are connected to the Audio-Precision analyzer analog inputs through a differential-tosingle ended (D2S) filter as shown below. The D2S filter contains a 1st order Passive pole at 120 kHz. The D2S
filter ensures the TAS2563 high performance class-D amplifier sees a fully differential matched loading at its
outputs. This prevents measurement errors due to loading effects of AUX-0025 filter on the class-D outputs.

7.3 Feature Description
7.3.1 PurePath™ Console 3 Software
The TAS2563 advanced features and device configuration should be performed using PurePath Console 3
(PPC3) software. The base software PPC3 is downloaded and installed from the TI website. Once installed
the TAS2563 application can be download from with-in PPC3. The PCC3 tool will calculate necessary register
coefficients that are described in the following sections. It is the recommended method to configure the device.
Once the TAS2563 application calculates and updates the device, the registers values can be read back using
the PPC3 tool for final system integration.
7.3.2 Device Mode and Address Selection
The TAS2563 has a global 7-bit I2C address 0x48. When enabled the device will additionally respond to I2C
commands at this address once it is put in I2C Mode. This is used to speed up device configuration when using
multiple TAS2563 devices and programming similar settings across all devices. The I2C ACK / NACK cannot be
used during the multi-device writes since multiple devices are responding to the I2C command. The I2C CRC
function should be used to ensure each device properly received the I2C commands. At the completion of writing
multiple devices using the global address, the CRC at I2C_CKSUM register should be checked on each device
using the local address for a proper value. The global I2C address can be disabled using I2C_GBL_EN register.
The I2C address is detected by sampling the address pins when SDZ pin is released. Additionally, the address
may be re-detected by setting I2C_AD_DET high after power up and the pins will be resampled.

7.3.3 General I2C Operation
The I2C bus employs two signals, SDA (data) and SCL (clock), to communicate between integrated circuits
in a system using serial data transmission. The address and data 8-bit bytes are transferred most-significant
bit (MSB) first. In addition, each byte transferred on the bus is acknowledged by the receiving device with an
acknowledge bit. Each transfer operation begins with the master device driving a start condition on the bus and
ends with the master device driving a stop condition on the bus. The bus uses transitions on the data terminal
(SDA) while the clock is at logic high to indicate start and stop conditions. A high-to-low transition on SDA
indicates a start, and a low-to-high transition indicates a stop. Normal data-bit transitions must occur within the
low time of the clock period. shows a typical sequence.
To configure the TAS2563 for I2C operation set the SPII2CZ_MISO pin to ground. The I2C address can then
be set using pins ADDR_SPICLK according to Table 7-3. The pin configures the two LSB bits of the following
7-bit binary address A6-A0 of 10011xx. This permits the I2C address of TAS2563 to be 0x4C(7-bit) through
0x4F(7-bit). For example, if ADDR_SPICLK is connected to ground the I2C address for the TAS2563 would be
0x4C(7-bit). This is equivalent to 0x98 (8-bit) for writing and 0x99 (8-bit) for reading. The ADDR_SPICLK should
be only pulled high to the IOVDD pin voltage.

The master generates the 7-bit slave address and the read/write (R/W) bit to open communication with another
device and then waits for an acknowledge condition. The device holds SDA low during the acknowledge clock
period to indicate acknowledgment. When this occurs, the master transmits the next byte of the sequence. Each
device is addressed by a unique 7-bit slave address plus R/W bit (1 byte). All compatible devices share the
same signals via a bi-directional bus using a wired-AND connection.
Use external pull-up resistors for the SDA and SCL signals to set the logic-high level for the bus. Pull Up
Resistor can be calculated as per the table below. For Capacitive Loads different from mentioned below in table,
use interpolated values.
Do not allow the SDA and SCL voltages to exceed the device supply voltage, IOVDD. The I2C pins are fault
tolerant and will not load the I2C bus when the device is powered down.

Figure 7-3. Typical I2C Sequence
There is no limit on the number of bytes that can be transmitted between start and stop conditions. When the
last word transfers, the master generates a stop condition to release the bus. Figure 7-3 shows a generic data
transfer sequence.
7.3.4 General SPI Operation
The TAS2563 operates as an SPI slave over the IOVDD voltage range. To enable SPI mode the SPII2CZ_MISO
pin is pulled to IOVDD using a resistor. During the device power up the pin state is queried and if high will enter
SPI mode.
In the SPI control mode, the TAS2563 uses the terminals SCL_SELZ as SS, ADDR_SPICLK as SCLK,
SPII2CZ_MISO as MISO, SDA_MOSI as MOSI; The SPI port allows full-duplex, synchronous, serial
communication between a host processor (the master) and peripheral devices (slaves). The SPI master (in
this case, the host processor) generates the synchronizing clock (driven onto SCLK) and initiates transmissions.
The SPI slave device depends on a master to start and synchronize transmissions. A transmission begins when
initiated by an SPI master. The byte from the SPI master begins shifting in on the slave MOSI terminal under the
control of the master serial clock (driven onto SCLK). As the byte shifts in on the MOSI terminal, a byte shifts out
on the MISO terminal to the master shift register.
The TAS2563 interface is designed so that with a clock-phase bit setting of 1 (typical microprocessor SPI control
bit CPHA = 1), the master begins driving its MOSI terminal and the slave begins driving its MISO terminal on
the first serial clock edge. The SSZ terminal can remain low between transmissions; however, the TAS2563
only interprets the first 8 bits transmitted after the falling edge of SSZ as a command byte, and the next 8 bits
as a data byte only if writing to a register. Reserved register bits should be written to their default values. The
TAS2563 is entirely controlled by registers. Reading and writing these registers is accomplished by an 8-bit
command sent to the MOSI terminal of the part prior to the data for that register. The command is structured
as shown in Table 7-5 below. The first 7 bits specify the address of the register which is being written or read,
from 0 to 127 (decimal). The command word ends with an R/W bit, which specifies the direction of data flow on
the serial bus. In the case of a register write, the R/W bit should be set to 0. A second byte of data is sent to
the MOSI terminal and contains the data to be written to the register. Reading of registers is accomplished in a
similar fashion. The 8-bit command word sends the 7-bit register address, followed by the R/W bit = 1 to signify a
register read is occurring. The 8-bit register data is then clocked out of the part on the MISO terminal during the
second 8 SCLK clocks in the frame.

7.3.5 Single-Byte and Multiple-Byte Transfers
The serial control interface supports both single-byte and multiple-byte read/write operations for all registers.
During multiple-byte read operations, the TAS2563 responds with data, a byte at a time, starting at the register
assigned, as long as the master device continues to respond with acknowledges.
The TAS2563 supports sequential I2C addressing. For write transactions, if a register is issued followed by data
for that register and all the remaining registers that follow, a sequential I2C write transaction has taken place. For
I2C sequential write transactions, the register issued then serves as the starting point, and the amount of data
subsequently transmitted, before a stop or start is transmitted, determines to how many registers are written.
7.3.6 Single-Byte Write
As shown in Figure 7-6, a single-byte data-write transfer begins with the master device transmitting a start
condition followed by the I2C device address and the read/write bit. The read/write bit determines the direction
of the data transfer. For a write-data transfer, the read/write bit must be set to 0. After receiving the correct
I2C device address and the read/write bit, the TAS2563 responds with an acknowledge bit. Next, the master
transmits the register byte corresponding to the device internal memory address being accessed. After receiving
the register byte, the device again responds with an acknowledge bit. Finally, the master device transmits a stop
condition to complete the single-byte data-write transfer.

7.3.8 Single-Byte Read
As shown in Figure 7-8, a single-byte data-read transfer begins with the master device transmitting a start

followed by a read are actually done. Initially, a write is done to transfer the address byte of the internal memory
address to be read. As a result, the read/write bit is set to a 0.
After receiving the TAS2563 address and the read/write bit, the device responds with an acknowledge bit. The
master then sends the internal memory address byte, after which the device issues an acknowledge bit. The
master device transmits another start condition followed by the TAS2563 address and the read/write bit again.
This time, the read/write bit is set to 1, indicating a read transfer. Next, the TAS2563 transmits the data byte from
the memory address being read. After receiving the data byte, the master device transmits a not-acknowledge
followed by a stop condition to complete the single-byte data read transfer.

7.3.10 Register Organization
Device configuration and coefficients are stored using a page and book scheme. Each page contains 128 bytes
and each book contains 256 pages. All device configuration registers are stored in book 0, page 0, which is the
default setting at power up (and after a software reset). The book and page can be set by the BOOK[7:0] and
PAGE[7:0] registers respectively.
7.3.11 Operational Modes
7.3.11.1 Hardware Shutdown
The device enters Hardware Shutdown mode if the SDZ pin is asserted low. In Hardware Shutdown mode, the
device consumes the minimum quiescent current from VDD and VBAT supplies. All registers loose state in this
mode and I2C communication is disabled.
In normal shutdown mode if SDZ is asserted low while audio is playing, the device will ramp down volume on the
audio, stop the Class-D switching, power down analog and digital blocks and finally put the device into Hardware
Shutdown mode. If configured in normal with timeout shutdown mode the device will force a hard shutdown after
a timeout of the configurable shutdown timer. Finally the device can be configured for hard shutdown and will not
attempt to gracefully stop the audio channel.

7.3.11.2 Software Shutdown
Software Shutdown mode powers down all analog blocks required to playback audio, but does not cause the
device to loose register state. Software Shutdown is enabled by asserting the MODE[1:0] register bits to 2'b10. If
audio is playing when Software Shutdown is asserted, the Class-D will volume ramp down before shutting down.
When deasserted, the Class-D will begin switching and volume ramp back to the programmed digital volume
setting.

to 2'b01. During mute the Class-D still switches, but transmits no audio content. If mute is deasserted, the device
will volume ramp back to the programmed digital volume setting.
7.3.11.4 Active
In Active Mode the Class-D switches and plays back audio. Speaker voltage and current sensing are operational
if enabled. Set the MODE[1:0] register bits to 2'b00 to enter active mode.
7.3.11.5 Perform Load Diagnostics
In Load Diagnostics Mode, TAS2563 checks the speaker terminal for an open or short. This can be used to
determine if a problem exists with the speaker or trace to the speaker. The entire operation is performed by

7.3.12 Faults and Status
During the power-up sequence, the power-on-reset circuit (POR) monitoring the VDD and VBAT pins will hold
the device in reset (including all configuration registers) until the supply is valid. The device will not exit hardware
shutdown until VDD and VBAT are valid and the SDZ pin is released. Once SDZ is released, the digital
core voltage regulator will power up, enabling detection of the operational mode. If VDD dips below the POR
threshold, the device will immediately be forced into a reset state.
The device also monitors the VBAT supply and holds the analog core in power down if the supply is below
the UVLO threshold. If the TAS2563 is in active operation and a UVLO fault occurs, the analog supplies will
immediately power down to protect the device. These faults are latching and require a transition through HW/SW
shutdown to clear the fault. The live and latched registers will report UVLO faults.
The device transitions into software shutdown mode if it detects any faults with the TDM clocks such as:
• Invalid SBCLK to FSYNC ratio
• Invalid FSYNC frequency
• Halting of SBCLK or FSYNC clocks

SLASET3D – APRIL 2019 – REVISED JANUARY 2024

Upon detection of a TDM clock error, the device transitions into software shutdown mode as quickly as possible
to limit the possibility of audio artifacts. Once all TDM clock errors are resolved, the device volume ramps back
to its previous playback state. During a TDM clock error, the IRQZ pin will assert low if the clock error interrupt
mask register bit is set low (INT_MASK[2]). The clock fault is also available for readback in the live or latched
fault status registers (INT_LIVE[2] and INT_LTCH[2]). Reading the latched fault status register (INT_LTCH[7:0])
clears the register.
The TAS2563 also monitors die temperature and Class-D load current and will enter software shutdown mode if
either of these exceed safe values. As with the TDM clock error, the IRQZ pin will assert low for these faults if
the appropriate fault interrupt mask register bit is set low (INT_MASK[0] for over temp and INT_MASK[1] for over
current). The fault status can also be monitored in the live and latched fault registers as with the TDM clock error.
Die over temp and Class-D over current errors can either be latching (for example the device will enter software
shutdown until a HW/SW shutdown sequence is applied) or they can be configured to automatically retry after
a prescribed time. This behavior can be configured in the OTE_RETRY and OCE_RETRY register bits (for over
temp and over current respectively). Even in latched mode, the Class-D will not attempt to retry after an over
temp or over current error until the retry time period (1.5 s) has elapsed. This prevents applying repeated stress
to the device in a rapid fashion that could lead to device damage. If the device has been cycled through SW/HW
shutdown, the device will only begin to operate after the retry time period.
The status registers (and IRQZ pin if enabled via the status mask register) also indicates limiter behavior
including when the limiter is activity, when VBAT is below the inflection point, when maximum attenuation has
been applied, when the limiter is in infinite hold and when the limiter has muted the audio.
Interrupts can be queried using the INT_LIVE[9:0] and INT_LTCH[13:0] registers and correspond to
the INT_MASK[10:0] Interrupts. The latched registers are cleared by writing the self clearing register
INT_CLR_LTCH high.

SLASET3D – APRIL 2019 – REVISED JANUARY 2024

The PDM inputs are sampled by the PDMCLK pin, which can be configured as either a PDM clock slave input
or a PDM clock master output. The PDM_MIC_EDGE and PDM_MIC_SLV register bits select the sample clock
edge and master/slave mode PDM inputs. In master mode the PDMCLK pin can disable the clocks (and drive a
logic 0) by setting the PDM_GATE_PAD0 register bits low.
When configured as a clock slave, the PDM clock input does not require a specific phase relationship to the
system clock (SBCLK in TDM/I2S Mode), but must be from the same source as audio sample rate. This is
equivalent to 64/32/16 (~3 MHz) or 128/64/32 (~6 MHz) times a single/double/quadruple speed sample rate. The
PDM rate is set by the PDM_RATE_PAD0 .
When PDMCLK pin is configured as a clock master, the TAS2563 will output a 50% duty cycle clock of frequency
that is set by the PDM_RATE_PAD0 and register bit (64/32/16 or 128/64/32 times a single/double/quadruple
speed sample rate).

7.4.2 TDM Port
The TAS2563 provides a flexible TDM serial audio port. The port can be configured to support a variety of
formats including stereo I2S, Left Justified and TDM. Mono audio playback is available via the SDIN pin. The
SDOUT pin is used to transmit sample streams including speaker voltage and current sense, VBAT voltage, die
temperature and channel gain.
The TDM serial audio port supports up to 16 32-bit time slots at 44.1/48 kHz, 8 32-bit time slots at a 88.2/96 kHz
sample rate and 4 32-bit time slots at a 176.4/192 kHz sample rate. The device supports 2 time slots at 32 bits
in width and 4 or 8 time slots at 16, 24 or 32 bits in width. Valid SBCLK to FSYNC ratios are 64, 96, 128, 192,
256, 384 and 512. The device will automatically detect the number of time slots and this does not need to be
programmed.

SLASET3D – APRIL 2019 – REVISED JANUARY 2024

By default, the TAS2563 will automatically detect the PCM playback sample rate. This can be disabled by setting
the AUTO_RATE register bit high and manually configuring the device.
The SAMP_RATE[2:0] register bits set the PCM audio sample rate when AUTO_RATE is enabled. The TAS2563
employs a robust clock fault detection engine that will automatically volume ramp down the playback path if
FSYNC does not match the configured sample rate (AUTO_RATE enabled) or the ratio of SBCLK to FSYNC is
not supported (minimizing any audible artifacts). Once the clocks are detected to be valid in both frequency and
ratio, the device will automatically volume ramp the playback path back to the configured volume and resume
playback.
When using the auto rate detection the sampling rate and SBCLK to FSYNC ratio detected on the TDM bus is
reported back on the read-only register FS_RATE and FS_RATIO respectively.
While the sampling rate of 192 kHz is supported, it is internally down-sampled to 96 kHz. Therefore audio
content greater than 40 kHz should not be applied to prevent aliasing. This additionally affects all processing
blocks like BOP and limiter which should use 96 kHz fs when accepting 192 kHz audio. It is recommend to use
Section 7.3.1 to configure the device.

(set by the RX_EDGE register bit). The RX_OFFSET[4:0] register bits define the number of SBCLK cycles from
the transition of FSYNC until the beginning of time slot 0. This is typically set to a value of 0 for Left Justified

The RX_SLEN[1:0] register bits set the length of the RX time slot. The length of the audio sample word within
the time slot is configured by the RX_WLEN[1:0] register bits. The RX port will left justify the audio sample
within the time slot by default, but this can be changed to right justification via the RX_JUSTIFY register bit.
The TAS2563 supports mono and stereo down mix playback ([L+R]/2) via the left time slot, right time slot and
time slot configuration register bits (RX_SLOT_L[3:0], RX_SLOT_R[3:0] and RX_SCFG[1:0] respectively). By
default the device will playback mono from the time slot equal to the I2C base address offset for playback. The
RX_SCFG [1:0] register bits can be used to override the playback source to the left time slot, right time slot or
stereo down mix set by the RX_SLOT_L[3:0] and RX_SLOT_R[3:0] register bits.
If time slot selections places reception either partially or fully beyond the frame boundary, the receiver will return
a null sample equivalent to a digitally muted sample.

The TDM port can transmit a number sample streams on the SDOUT pin including speaker voltage sense,
speaker current sense, VBAT voltage, die temperature and channel gain. Figure 7-14 below illustrates the
alignment of time slots to the beginning of a frame and how a given sample stream is mapped to time slots.
Either the rising or falling edge of SBCLK can be used to transmit data on the SDOUT pin, which can be
configured by setting the TX_EDGE register bit. The TX_OFFSET register defines the number SBCLK cycles
between the start of a frame and the beginning of time slot 0. This would typically be programmed to 0 for
Left Justified format and 1 for I2S format. The TDM TX can either transmit logic 0 or Hi-Z depending on the
setting of the TX_FILL register bit setting. An optional bus keeper will weakly hold the state of SDOUT when all
devices driving are Hi-Z. Since only one bus keeper is required on SDOUT, this feature can be disabled via the
TX_KEEPEN register bit. The bus-keeper can additionally be configured to be enabled for only 1LSB cycle or
always using TX_KEEPLN and to drive the full or half cycle of the LSB using TX_KEEPCY.
Each sample stream is composed of either one or two 8-bit time slots. , so they will always utilize two TX time
slots. The VBAT voltage stream is 10-bit precision, and can either be transmitted left justified in a 16-bit word
(using two time slots) or can be truncated to 8-bits (the top 8 MSBs) and be transmitted in a single time slot. This
is configured by setting VBAT_SLEN register bit. The Die temperature and gain are both 8-bit precision and are
transmitted in a single time slot.

The time slot register for each sample stream defines where the MSB transmission begins. For instance, if
VSNS_SLOT is set to 2, the upper 8 MSBs will be transmitted in time slot 2 and the lower 8 LSBs will be
transmitted in time slot 3. Each sample stream can be individually enabled or disabled. This is useful to manage
limited TDM bandwidth since it may not be necessary to transmit all streams for all devices on the bus.
It is important to ensure that time slot assignments for actively transmitted sample streams do not conflict. For
instance, if VSNS_SLOT is set to 2 and ISNS_SLOT is set to 3, the lower 8 LSBs of voltage sense will conflict
with the upper 8 MSBs of current sense. This will produce unpredictable transmission results in the conflicting bit
slots (for example the priority is not defined).
The current and voltage values are transmitted at the full 16-bit measured values by default. The IVMON_LEN
register can be used to transmit only the 8 MSB bits in one slot or 12 MSB bits values across multiple slots.
The special 12-bit mode is used when only 24-bit I2S/TDM data can be processed by the host processor. The
device should be configured with the voltage-sense slot and current-sense slot off by 1 slot and will consume 3
consecutive 8-bit slots. In this mode the device will transmit the first 12 MSB bits followed by the second 12 MSB
bits specified by the preceding slot.
If time slot selections place transmission beyond the frame boundary, the transmitter will truncate transmission at
the frame boundary.
It is recommended to keep the following slot ordering:
ISNS_SLOT<VSNS_SLOT<VBAT_SLOT<TEMP_SLOT<GAIN_SLOT<BIL_ILIM_SLOT.

7.4.3 Playback Signal Path
7.4.3.1 Digital Signal Processor
An on-chip, low-latency DSP supports Texas Instruments' Smart Amp speaker protection algorithms to maximize
loudness while maintaining safe speaker conditions. The DSP implemented in the TAS2563 device offers a
variety of algorithm features such as rea time tracking, ultrasound and bass proccessing. Additionally, TAS2563
QFN has a DSP with extra feature such as Smart Bass, Psychoacoustic bass (PBE) and Automatic gain control
(AGC).
7.4.3.2 High Pass Filter
Excessive DC and low frequency content in audio playback signal can damage loudspeakers. The TAS2563
employs a high-pass filter (HPF) to prevent this from occurring for the PCM playback path. The HPF can
be disabled using register HPF_EN. The HPF Bi-Quad filter coefficients can be changed from the default 2
Hz using the HPFC_N0, HPFC_N1, HPFC_D1 registers using the equation [N, D] = butter(1, fc/(fs/2), 'high');
round(N(0)*2^31);. These coefficients should be calculated and set using Section 7.3.1.

Amplifier output level settings are presented in dBV (dB relative to 1 Vrms) with a full scale digital audio input
(0 dBFS) and the digital volume control set to 0 dB. It should be noted that these levels may not be achievable
because of analog clipping in the amplifier, so they should be used to convey gain only. Table 7-55 below shows
gain settings that can be programmed via the AMP_LEVEL register.

Advc is the digital volume control setting, 0 dB to -100 dB in 0.5 dB steps
AAMP is the amplifier output level setting in dBV

Settings greater than 0xC8 are interpreted as mute. When a change in digital volume control occurs, the device
ramps the volume to the new setting based on the DVC_RAMP register bits. If DVC_RAMP is set to 0x0000
0000, volume ramping is disabled. This can be used to speed up startup, shutdown and digital volume changes
when volume ramping is handled by the system master.
The digital voltage control registers DVC_PCM represent the volume in a 2.X format. To calculate the value to
write to these 4 registers apply the following formula to the desired dB DVC_PCM = round(10^(dB/20)*2^30).
A volume ramp rate can be set using DVC_RAMP and represents a rate in 1.X format. To calculate the
value to write to these 4 registers apply the following formula DVC_RAMP = round((1-exp(-1/(0.2*fs*time in

7.4.3.6 Supply Tracking Limiters with Brown Out Prevention
The TAS2563 monitors battery voltage (VBAT) and the class-D voltage (PVDD) along with the audio signal to
automatically decrease gain when the audio signal peaks exceed a programmable threshold. This helps prevent
clipping and extends playback time through end of charge battery conditions. The limiters threshold can be
configured to track the monitored voltage below a programmable inflection point with a programmable slope. A
minimum threshold sets the limit of threshold reduction from the voltage tracking. Configurable attack rate, hold
time and release rate are provided to shape the dynamic response of each limiter. The total attenuation is the

sum of both the VBAT and PVDD limiter. If the ICLA is enabled the actual attenuation is based on the ICLA
configuration using the calculated attenuation value of all devices on the selected ICLA bus.
A Brown Out Prevention (BOP) feature provides a priority input to provide a very fast response to transient dips
in the battery supply (VBAT) which at end of charge conditions that can cause system level brown out. When
the selected supply dips below the brown-out threshold the BOP will begin reducing gain with an first attack
latency of less than 10 µs and a configurable attack rate. When the VBAT supply rises above the brownout
threshold, the BOP will begin to release after the programmed hold time. During a BOP event the limiter updates
will be paused. This is to prevent a limiter from releasing during a BOP event. The VBAT and PVDD limiters are
enabled by setting the respective LIMB_EN and LIMP_EN bits high.

The limiters have configurable attack rates, hold times and release rates, which are available via
the LIMB_ATK_RT[2:0], LIMB_HLD_TM[2:0], LIMB_RLS_RT[2:0] register bits respectively for VBAT and
LIMP_ATK_RT[2:0], LIMP_HLD_TM[2:0], LIMP_RLS_RT[2:0] register bits respectively for PVDD . The limiters
attack and release step sizes can be set by configuring the LIMB_ATK_ST[1:0] and LIMB_RLS_ST[1:0] register
bits respectively for VBAT and LIMP_ATK_ST[1:0] and LIMP_RLS_ST[1:0] register bits respectively for PVDD.
For sampling rates less that 44.1kHz and greater than 8 kHz the minimum attack rate is 20µs and for sampling
rates of 8kHz or less the minimum attack rate is 40µs.
A maximum level of attenuation applied by the limiters and brown out prevention feature is configurable via the
LIM_MAX_ATN register. This attenuation limit is shared between the features. For instance, if the maximum
attenuation is set to 6 dB and the limiters have reduced gain by 4 dB, the brown out prevention feature will only
be able to reduce the gain further by another 2 dB. If the limiter or brown out prevention feature is attacking and
it reaches the maximum attenuation, gain will not be reduced any further.
The limiter max attenuation LIM_MAX_ATN represent the limit in a 1.X format. To calculate the value to write
to the 4 registers by apply the following formula to the desired dB using equation LIMB_MAX_ATN = round(10^(dB/20)*2^31).

The BOP feature has a separate attack rate BOP_ATK_RT, attack step size BOP_ATK_ST and hold time
BOP_HLD_TM from the battery tracking limiter. The BOP feature uses the LIMB_RLS_RT register setting to
release after a brown out event. The rates are based on the number of audio samples and actual time values
can be calculated by multiplying by 1/fs. For example the attack rate of 4 samples at 48 ksps would be

The TAS2563 can also shutdown the device when a brown out event occurs if the BOP_MUTE register bit is
set high. For the device to continue playing audio again, the device must transition through a SW/HW shutdown
state. Setting the BOP_INF_HLD high will cause the limiter to stay in the hold state (i.e. never release) after
a cleared brown out event until either the device transitions through a mute or SW/HW shutdown state or the
register bit BOP_HLD_CLR is written to a high value (which will cause the device to exit the hold state and begin
releasing). This bit is self clearing and will always readback low. Figure 7-18 below illustrates the entering and

The TAS2563 internal processing algorithm automatically enables the boost when needed. A look-ahead
algorithm monitors the battery voltage and the digital audio stream. When the speaker output approaches the
battery voltage the boost is enabled in-time to supply the required speaker output voltage. When the boost is
no longer required it is disabled and bypassed to maximize efficiency. The boost can be configured in one of
two modes. The first is low in-rush (Class-G) supporting only boost on-off and has the lowest in-rush current.

needed will be at this voltage. In class-H mode of operation the boost voltage is automatically selected based on
the audio signal but, will not exceed this set value.

sharing. The boost syncing among multiple devices is enabled using BST_SYNC and then each part is
configured to be on 0 or 180 phase using BST_PA. This avoids peak current align on and clock edges and
spreads out battery ripple. The phase of additional devices can be set relative to the master using register

The speaker open and short thresholds are configured using the respective LDG_RES_UT and LDG_RES_LT
registers using equation round(Ω/7*2^22). The load diagnostic mode can be run in two ways. First if the device
is in Section 7.3.11.2 the load diagnostic mode can be run by setting LDG_MODE high. The diagnostic will be
run and the device will return to Section 7.3.11.2. The load diagnostics can also be run before transitioning to
Section 7.3.11.4. This is done by setting the MODE register to Section 7.3.11.5. If the load is within the specified
range the device will transition to Section 7.3.11.4 otherwise it will transition to Section 7.3.11.2. When the load
diagnostics is run it will play a 22 kHz at -35 dBFS for 100 ms and measure the resistance of the speaker trace.
The result is averaged over the time specified by the IVSNS_AVG register. The measured speaker impedance
can be read from LDS_RES_VAL1 using the equations Impedance = 7*(LD_RES_VAL1)/2^22) Ω.

7.4.8 Clocks and PLL
In TDM/I2S Mode, the device operates from SBCLK. Table 7-95 and Table 7-96 below shows the valid SBCLK
frequencies for each sample rate and SBCLK to FSYNC ratio (for 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz family frequencies
respectively.
If the sample rate is properly configured via the SAMP_RATE[1:0] bits, no additional configuration is required
as long as the SBCLK to FSYNC ratio is valid. The device will detect improper SBCLK frequencies and SBCLK
to FSYNC ratios and volume ramp down the playback path to minimize audible artifacts. After the clock error
is detected the device will enter a low power halt mode after CLK_HALT_TIMER if CLK_HALT_EN is enabled.
Additionally the device can automatically power up and down on valid clock signals if CLK_ERR_PWR_EN
is set. The device sampling rate should not be changed while this feature is enabled. Additionally, the
CLK_HALT_EN should be set when CLK_ERR_PWR_EN is set for this feature to work properly.

7.4.9 Thermal Foldback
The TAS2563 monitors the die temperature and can automatically limit the audio signal when the die
temperature reaches a set threshold. It is recommended to use Section 7.3.1 to configure the thermal foldback
as the software will perform the necessary math for each register.
Thermal foldback can be disabled using TF_EN. If the die temperature reaches TF_TEMP_TH this feature
will begin to attenuate the audio signal to prevent the device from shutting down due to over-temperature. It
will attenuate the audio signal by TF_LIMS db per degree of temperature over TF_TEMP_TH. The thermal
foldback with attack at a fixed rate of 0.25 dB per sample. A maximum attenuation of TF_MAX_ATTN can be
specified. However if the device continue to heat up eventually the device over-temperature will be triggered.
The attenuation will be held for TF_HOLD_CNT samples before the attenuation will begin releasing.

8.1 Application Information
The TAS2563 is a digital input high efficiency Class-D audio power amplifier with advanced battery current
management and an integrated Class-H boost converter. In auto passthrough mode, the Class-H boost
converter generates the Class-D amplifier supply rail. During low Class-D output power, the boost improves
efficiency by deactivating and connecting VBAT directly to the Class-D amplifier supply. When high power audio
is required, the boost quickly activates to provide louder audio than a stand-alone amplifier connected directly
to the battery. To enable load monitoring, the TAS2563 constantly measures the current and voltage across the
load and provides a digital stream of this information back to a processor. It is recommended to configure the
TAS2563 using Section 7.3.1.

8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure
8.2.2.1 Mono/Stereo Configuration
In this application, the device is assumed to be operating in mono mode. See Section 7.3.2 for information on
changing the I2C address of the TAS2563 to support stereo operation. Mono or stereo configuration does not
impact the device performance.
8.2.2.2 Boost Converter Passive Devices
The boost converter requires three passive devices that are labeled L1, C1 and C2 in Section 8.2 and whose
specifications are provided in Table 8-1. These specifications are based on the design of the TAS2563 and are
necessary to meet the performance targets of the device. In particular, L1 should not be allowed to enter in the
current saturation region. The saturation current for L1 should be > ILIM to deliver Class-D peak power.
Additionally, the ratio of L1/C2 (the derated value of C2 at 11.5 V should be used in this ratio) has to be lesser
than 1/3 for boost stability. This 1/3 ratio should be maintained including the worst case variation of L1 and
C2. To satisfy sufficient energy transfer, L1 needs to be ≥ 0.47 μH at the boost switching frequency (100 kHz
to 4 MHz). Using a 0.47 μH will have more boost ripple than a 1.0 μH or 2.2 μH but the high PSRR should
minimize the effect from the additional ripple. Finally, the minimum C2 (derated value at programmed boost
voltage) should be > 3.3 μF for Class-D power delivery specification.

8.2.2.3 EMI Passive Devices
The TAS2563 supports edge-rate control to minimize EMI, but the system designer may want to include passive
devices on the Class-D output devices. These passive devices that are labeled L2, L3, C3 and C4 in Section 8.2
and their recommended specifications are provided in Table 8-1. If C3 and C4 are used, L2 and L3 must also be
installed, and C3 and C4 must be placed after L2 and L3 respectively to maintain the stability of the output stage.
8.2.2.4 Miscellaneous Passive Devices
The GREG Capacitor requires 100 nF to meet boost and Class-D power delivery and efficiency specs. For best
device performance, the GREG capacitor should be placed very close to the device and be routed with wide
traces to minimize the impact of PCB parasitic effects.

SLASET3D – APRIL 2019 – REVISED JANUARY 2024

9 Power Supply Recommendations
9.1 Power Supplies
The TAS2563 requires four power supplies:
•

•

•

Boost Input (terminal: VBAT)
– Voltage: 2.5 V to 5.5 V
– Max Current: 5 A for ILIM = 4.0 A (default)
Analog Supply (terminal: VDD)
– Voltage: 1.62 V to 1.95 V
– Max Current: 30 mA
IO Supply (terminal: IOVDD)
– Voltage: 1.62 V to 3.6 V
– Max Current: 30 mA

The decoupling capacitors for the power supplies should be placed close to the device terminals.

9.2 Power Supply Sequencing
The power rail may be brought up and down in any order. There is no requirement on sequencing. However if
VDD is present without VBAT an additional rise in VDD current will be observed until VBAT is present.
When the supplies have settled, the SDZ terminal can be set HIGH to operate the device. Additionally the SDZ
pin can be tied to VDD and the internal POR will perform a reset of the device. After a hardware or software
reset additional commands to the device should be delayed for 100 uS to allow the OTP to load. The above
sequence should be completed before any I2C operation.
9.2.1 Boost Supply Details
The boost supply (VBAT) and associated passives need to be able to support the current requirements of the
device. By default, the peak current limit of the boost is set to 4 A. Refer to for information on changing the
current limit. A minimum of a 10 µF capacitor is recommended on the boost supply to quickly support changes in
required current. Refer to Section 8.2 for the schematic.
The current requirements can also be reduced by lowering the gain of the amplifier, or in response to decreasing
battery through the use of the battery-tracking feature of the TAS2563 described in Section 7.4.3.6.
9.2.2 External Boost Mode (Boost Bypass Mode)
Its is very important that during external boost mode, VBAT and SW should be open on board. For more
information refer to application note document SLAA972

10 Layout
10.1 Layout Guidelines
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Place the boost inductor between VBAT and SW close to device terminals with no VIAS between the device
terminals and the inductor.
Place the capacitor between VBST close to device terminals with no VIAS between the device terminals and
capacitor.
Place the capacitor between VBST/VBAT and GND close to device terminals with no VIAS between the
device terminals and capacitor.
Use minimal amount of VIAS for traces that carry high current. These include the traces for VBST, SW, VBAT,
PGND and the speaker OUT_P, OUT_M.
Use epoxy filled vias for the interior pads.
Connect VSNS_P, VSNS_N as close as possible to the speaker.
– VSNS_P, VSNS_N should be connected between the EMI ferrite and the speaker if EMI ferrites are used
on OUT_P, OUT_M.
– EMI ferrites must be used if EMI capacitors are used on OUT_P, OUT_M.
Use a ground plane with multiple vias for each terminal to create a low-impedance connection to GND for
minimum ground noise.
Use supply decoupling capacitors as shown in Section 8.2 and described in Section 9.1.
Place EMI ferrites, if used, close to the device.

Material type: When designated, preproduction parts are prototypes/experimental devices, and are not yet approved or released for full production. Testing and final process, including without limitation quality assurance,
reliability performance testing, and/or process qualification, may not yet be complete, and this item is subject to further changes or possible discontinuation. If available for ordering, purchases will be subject to an additional
waiver at checkout, and are intended for early internal evaluation purposes only. These items are sold without warranties of any kind.
(3)

RoHS values: Yes, No, RoHS Exempt. See the TI RoHS Statement for additional information and value definition.

(4)

Lead finish/Ball material: Parts may have multiple material finish options. Finish options are separated by a vertical ruled line. Lead finish/Ball material values may wrap to two lines if the finish value exceeds the maximum
column width.
(5)

MSL rating/Peak reflow: The moisture sensitivity level ratings and peak solder (reflow) temperatures. In the event that a part has multiple moisture sensitivity ratings, only the lowest level per JEDEC standards is shown.
Refer to the shipping label for the actual reflow temperature that will be used to mount the part to the printed circuit board.
(6)

Part marking: There may be an additional marking, which relates to the logo, the lot trace code information, or the environmental category of the part.

Multiple part markings will be inside parentheses. Only one part marking contained in parentheses and separated by a "~" will appear on a part. If a line is indented then it is a continuation of the previous line and the two
combined represent the entire part marking for that device.
