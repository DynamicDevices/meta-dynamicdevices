## Root of Trust and Secure Boot Chain Analysis

### i.MX93 Hardware Root of Trust

**Primary Root of Trust**: NXP i.MX93 EdgeLock Enclave (ELE)
- **Hardware Security Module**: Dedicated Cortex-M33 security co-processor
- **Key Storage**: Hardware-protected key storage in EdgeLock Enclave
- **Boot ROM**: Immutable ROM code establishing initial root of trust
- **AHAB (Advanced High Assurance Boot)**: NXP's secure boot implementation for i.MX93

### Complete Secure Boot Chain

#### 1. Hardware Boot Sequence
```
ROM Boot → AHAB → U-Boot SPL → U-Boot → OP-TEE → Linux Kernel
```

**Boot ROM (Immutable)**:
- Validates AHAB container signatures using fused public keys
- Establishes initial root of trust from hardware

**AHAB (Advanced High Assurance Boot)**:
- Validates and loads signed U-Boot SPL
- Uses RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256/P-384 signatures
- Supports key revocation through eFuse programming

#### 2. Component Signing Configuration

**U-Boot SPL Signing**:
- **Key Location**: `${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/spldev.key/crt`
- **Algorithm**: RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256
- **Validation**: AHAB verifies SPL signature before execution
- **Production**: Keys stored in Foundries.io secure infrastructure

**U-Boot Proper Signing**:
- **Key Location**: `${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/ubootdev.key/crt`
- **FIT Image**: Signed FIT image containing U-Boot, device tree, and configuration
- **Validation**: SPL verifies U-Boot signature before execution

**TF-A (Trusted Firmware-A) Signing**:
- **Key Location**: `${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/tf-a/privkey_ec_prime256v1.pem`
- **Algorithm**: ECDSA P-256
- **Chain of Trust**: Verified by previous boot stage

**OP-TEE Signing**:
- **Key Location**: `${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/opteedev.key`
- **Trusted Application Signing**: Individual TA signing capability
- **Validation**: TF-A verifies OP-TEE signature

#### 3. Linux Kernel and Module Signing

**Kernel Image Signing**:
- **FIT Image**: Kernel packaged in signed FIT image
- **Key**: Uses U-Boot signing key for FIT image verification
- **Validation**: U-Boot verifies kernel FIT image signature

**Kernel Module Signing**:
- **Key Location**: `${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/privkey_modsign.pem`
- **Certificate**: `${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/x509_modsign.crt`
- **Runtime Validation**: Kernel verifies module signatures during loading
- **Configuration**: `CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=y` enforces signature verification

#### 4. PMU Secure Boot (MCXC143VFM)

**MCUboot Implementation**:
- **Bootloader**: MCUboot v2.1.0 for MCXC143VFM power management controller
- **Algorithm**: RSA-2048 signature verification
- **Key File**: `root-rsa-2048.pem`
- **Security Features**:
  - `CONFIG_BOOT_VALIDATE_SLOT0=y` - Validates primary firmware slot
  - `CONFIG_BOOT_UPGRADE_ONLY=y` - Prevents downgrades
  - Signed image requirement for all PMU firmware updates

### Key Management and Storage

#### Development vs Production Key Handling

**Development Builds** (Local KAS):
- All signing **DISABLED** for development speed
- Dummy key paths point to `${TOPDIR}/bitbake.lock`
- No actual signing performed locally

**Production Builds** (Foundries.io Cloud):
- **Factory Keys Directory**: `conf/factory-keys/`
- **Key Types**:
  - RSA-2048 keys for bootloader components
  - ECDSA P-256 keys for TF-A
  - X.509 certificates for kernel modules
- **Key Storage**: Foundries.io secure build infrastructure
- **Key Rotation**: Supported through factory configuration updates

#### eFuse Programming for Production

**AHAB Key Hashes**:
- Public key hashes burned into SoC eFuses during production
- Immutable root of trust establishment
- Key revocation capability through additional eFuse programming

**Production Process**:
1. Generate factory-specific key pairs
2. Program public key hashes to SoC eFuses
3. Configure Foundries.io build system with private keys
4. Enable signing in production builds

### OTA Update Security

#### Signed Update Verification

**OSTree Signature Verification**:
- All OTA updates signed by Foundries.io
- GPG signature verification before deployment
- Atomic updates with rollback capability

**Update Chain Validation**:
1. **TUF (The Update Framework)**: Metadata signing and verification
2. **OSTree Commit Signing**: Individual commit signature verification
3. **Component Validation**: Each updated component verified against signing keys
4. **Rollback Protection**: Version monotonicity enforcement

**Foundries.io OTA Security**:
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation capability
- **Revocation**: Compromised key revocation support
- **Attestation**: Device attestation before update delivery

### Encrypted Filesystem Status

**Current Implementation**: 
- **No filesystem encryption** currently implemented
- **Rationale**: Non-removable eMMC storage reduces physical access risk
- **Future Consideration**: LUKS/dm-crypt can be enabled if customer requirements demand it

**Available Capabilities**:
- Hardware crypto acceleration via EdgeLock Enclave
- LUKS/dm-crypt kernel support available
- Key management through OP-TEE secure storage
