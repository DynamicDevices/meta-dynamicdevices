|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **KASLR Bypass** | 🟡 VULNERABLE | ✅ PROTECTED | `kernel.kptr_restrict=1` |
| **Info Disclosure** | 🟡 EXPOSED | ✅ RESTRICTED | `kernel.dmesg_restrict=1` |
| **Kernel Address Leak** | 🟡 POSSIBLE | ✅ BLOCKED | `CONFIG_SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT=y` |
| **Privilege Escalation** | 🟡 HIGHER RISK | ✅ MITIGATED | Combined restrictions |

### 2.3 Verification Commands (Post-Deployment)

```bash
# Verify kernel pointer restriction
cat /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
# Expected: 1

# Verify dmesg restriction
cat /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict  
# Expected: 1

# Test kernel config
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT
# Expected: CONFIG_SECURITY_DMESG_RESTRICT=y

# Test access restriction (as non-root user)
