# SSH Security Hardening Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the SSH security hardening implemented for Dynamic Devices embedded systems to address security compliance requirements and eliminate SSH root login vulnerabilities.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. SSH Root Login Disabled ✅
- **Issue**: Default OpenSSH configuration allows root login with `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`
- **Solution**: Explicitly set `PermitRootLogin no` to completely disable root SSH access
- **Impact**: Root access now only available via local console, eliminating remote root attack vector

### 2. Password Authentication Disabled ✅
- **Issue**: Password authentication vulnerable to brute force attacks
- **Solution**: Set `PasswordAuthentication no` to enforce key-based authentication only
- **Impact**: SSH access requires cryptographic keys, significantly improving security

### 3. User Access Control ✅
- **Issue**: No restrictions on which users can SSH to the system
- **Solution**: Added `AllowUsers fio` and `DenyUsers root` directives
- **Impact**: Only the `fio` user can access the system via SSH

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`meta-dynamicdevices-bsp/recipes-connectivity/openssh/openssh_%.bbappend`**
   - Yocto recipe append to install hardened SSH configuration
   - Replaces default `sshd_config` with security-hardened version

2. **`meta-dynamicdevices-bsp/recipes-connectivity/openssh/openssh/sshd_config_hardened`**
   - Hardened SSH daemon configuration file
   - Implements all security best practices

3. **`meta-dynamicdevices-bsp/recipes-connectivity/openssh/openssh/banner`**
   - Security banner displayed before login
   - Legal notice for authorized access only

### Key Security Settings

```bash
# Root access completely disabled
PermitRootLogin no

# Password authentication disabled (keys only)
PasswordAuthentication no
KbdInteractiveAuthentication no

# User access control
AllowUsers fio
DenyUsers root
DenyGroups root

# Disable potentially risky features
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no
PermitTunnel no

# Connection limits and timeouts
MaxAuthTries 3
MaxSessions 5
MaxStartups 5:30:10
LoginGraceTime 2m
ClientAliveInterval 15
ClientAliveCountMax 4

# Enhanced logging and monitoring
LogLevel INFO
SyslogFacility AUTH
Banner /etc/ssh/banner
```

## Security Compliance

This implementation addresses the following security requirements:

### Runtime Security Tests
- **`runtime_004`**: SSH Security Configuration ✅
  - Root login disabled
  - Password authentication disabled
  - User access restricted
  - Security banner implemented

### Production Security
- Eliminates SSH-based root access attack vector
- Enforces cryptographic authentication
- Provides audit trail through enhanced logging
- Displays legal access notice

## Build Integration

### Automatic Application
The SSH hardening is automatically applied when building images that include the `ssh-server-openssh` IMAGE_FEATURE:

```bash
# In lmp-factory-image.bb
IMAGE_FEATURES += "ssh-server-openssh"
```

### Verification
After flashing a new image, verify the SSH hardening:

```bash
# Check SSH configuration
ssh fio@[TARGET_IP] "sudo cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep -E '^[^#]*(PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|AllowUsers)'"

# Expected output:
# PermitRootLogin no
# PasswordAuthentication no
# AllowUsers fio

# Verify root login is blocked
ssh root@[TARGET_IP]  # Should fail with "Permission denied"
```

## Development Workflow Impact

### No Impact on Development
- Development workflow unchanged - still use `fio` user
- SSH key authentication still works as before
- Passwordless sudo still available for `fio` user

### Enhanced Security
- Root access only via local console (UART/display)
- SSH brute force attacks eliminated
- Clear audit trail of all SSH access

## Security Compliance Status

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| SSH Root Login | ✅ PASS | `PermitRootLogin no` |
| Password Auth | ✅ PASS | `PasswordAuthentication no` |
| User Restrictions | ✅ PASS | `AllowUsers fio`, `DenyUsers root` |
| Security Banner | ✅ PASS | Legal notice displayed |
| Connection Limits | ✅ PASS | MaxAuthTries=3, MaxSessions=5 |

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot SSH as Root
**Expected Behavior**: Root SSH access is completely disabled for security.
**Solution**: Use `fio` user and `sudo` for administrative tasks.

### Password Authentication Not Working
**Expected Behavior**: Password authentication is disabled for security.
**Solution**: Use SSH key authentication only.

### Connection Rejected
**Possible Cause**: User not in AllowUsers list.
**Solution**: Only `fio` user is permitted SSH access.

**Security Note**: This hardening significantly improves the security posture by eliminating common SSH attack vectors while maintaining full functionality for legitimate users.
