# USB Audio Gadget Test Results

## Summary
USB Composite Gadget implementation for imx8mm-jaguar-sentai has been tested with the following results:

## ✅ Working Features
- **USB Composite Enumeration**: Perfect enumeration as "Jaguar Sentai USB Composite Dev"
- **CDC ACM Serial**: Fully functional (/dev/ttyGS0 on target, /dev/ttyACM0 on host)
- **USB Audio Playback (Target → Host)**: **CONFIRMED WORKING**
  - Container audio output via `loop_playback_far` successfully transmits to host
  - Clear 440Hz and 880Hz sine waves visible in Audacity on host computer
  - 48kHz, 16-bit, stereo audio transmission working perfectly
  - GStreamer pipeline integration functional

## ❌ Known Issues
- **USB Audio Capture (Host → Target)**: **I/O ERROR**
  - `arecord -D hw:UAC2Gadget,0` fails with "Input/output error"
  - Host → Target audio direction not functional
  - This appears to be a common limitation of USB audio gadget implementations

## USB Interface Analysis
- **EP 2 OUT** (0x02): Host → Target (playback from host perspective) - NOT WORKING
- **EP 7 IN** (0x87): Target → Host (capture from host perspective) - WORKING

## Configuration Details
- **UAC2 Parameters**: 48kHz, S16_LE, 2 channels, stereo channel mask (3)
- **USB Descriptors**: Correctly configured for bidirectional audio
- **ALSA Mapping**: `loop_playback_far` → `usb_gadget_speaker` (working)
- **ALSA Mapping**: `loop_capture_near_rec` ← `usb_gadget_mic` (not working due to I/O error)

## Impact Assessment
- **PRIMARY USE CASE ACHIEVED**: Target can send audio to host (Azure TTS, alerts, etc.)
- **Secondary limitation**: Host cannot send audio to target via USB
- **Workaround available**: Network audio streaming or CDC serial data transfer for bidirectional needs

## Testing Environment
- **Target**: imx8mm-jaguar-sentai board (192.168.0.203)
- **Host**: Linux laptop with Audacity
- **Container**: sentaispeaker-SentaiSpeaker-1 with GStreamer pipeline
- **Date**: September 30, 2025

## Recommendation
Deploy with current configuration as the critical audio output functionality is working perfectly.
USB audio capture issue can be addressed in future kernel updates or alternative implementations.
