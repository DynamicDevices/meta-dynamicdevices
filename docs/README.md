# Documentation Structure

This folder contains formal documentation, reports, and reference materials for the meta-dynamicdevices project.

## Folder Structure

### `/security/`
**Purpose**: Security compliance reports and assessments  
**Audience**: Technical leadership, C-suite, regulatory bodies  
**Contents**: Formal security compliance reports with versioning and git commit references

### `/reports/`
**Purpose**: Build reports, testing results, and project status documents  
**Audience**: Project managers, technical leads  
**Contents**: Build-specific reports, testing checklists, issues tracking, next steps

### `/investigations/`
**Purpose**: Technical investigation reports and research findings  
**Audience**: Engineers, technical team  
**Contents**: Deep-dive technical investigations, security research, implementation analysis

### `/templates/`
**Purpose**: Template files and examples  
**Audience**: Developers  
**Contents**: Recipe templates, configuration examples, boilerplate files

### `/datasheets/`
**Purpose**: Hardware datasheets and reference materials  
**Audience**: Hardware engineers, developers  
**Contents**: Component datasheets, hardware specifications

### `/archive/`
**Purpose**: Archived documentation and historical records  
**Audience**: Reference only  
**Contents**: Deprecated documentation, historical reports

## Engineering Documentation

**For day-to-day engineering documentation, guides, and tutorials, see the `wiki/` folder.**

The wiki contains:
- Development guides and workflows
- Hardware reference materials
- Feature implementation guides
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Quick-start guides

## Document Lifecycle

1. **Engineering Guides** → `wiki/` (maintainable, living documentation)
2. **Formal Reports** → `docs/reports/` (versioned, point-in-time)
3. **Security Assessments** → `docs/security/` (compliance, regulatory)
4. **Technical Research** → `docs/investigations/` (research findings)
5. **Templates** → `docs/templates/` (reusable patterns)

## Maintenance

- **Wiki**: Updated continuously by engineers
- **Reports**: Created as needed, archived when superseded
- **Security**: Generated periodically with versioning
- **Investigations**: Created for specific research, referenced long-term
- **Templates**: Updated when patterns change

*Keep this structure clean and purposeful. Move engineering guides to wiki, formal reports here.*
