3 i.MX 93 power architecture
The power architecture of the chip is established with the presumption that the most affordable systems are built
for the scenario in which the PMIC is used to supply all the power rails to the processor.
Figure 1 shows the power architecture diagram for the entire SoC.
Note: Figure 1 shows only the power supplies and does not show the capacitors that can be required for
internal LDO regulators.
The values in Figure 1 are for reference purpose only. For actual values, refer i.MX 93 EVK Applications
Processors Data Sheet.
From an architectural standpoint, most SoC digital and analog logic can be power gated in Low-power mode
through an external PMIC supply or an internal power switch.

4 i.MX 93 power overview
This section describes the power domains and modes for the i.MX 93 processor.

4.1 i.MX 93 power domains overview
To optimize the power consumption in Low-power modes, i.MX 93 has multiple power domains. As a result,
most SoC digital and analog logics are power gated with an internal power switch or an external supply from
PMIC in Low-power mode.
Note: The values in Table 3 are for reference purpose only. For actual values, refer i.MX 93 EVK Applications
Processors Data Sheet.

Reference Manual (document IMX93RM).

4.2 i.MX 93 power mode overview
The i.MX 93 supports the following power modes:
• Run mode: In this mode, the Cortex-A55 CPU is active and running. Some portions can be shut off for power
saving.
• Low-power run mode: This mode is defined as a Low-power run mode with all external power rails on. In
this mode, all unnecessary power domains (MIX) can be off. The AONMIX and internal modules, such as
OSC24M/PLL, are an exception in this mode. The Cortex CPU in AONMIX handles all the computing and
data processing. Cortex-A55 is powered down and DRAM can be in self-refresh/retention mode.

i.MX 93 Power Consumption Measurement
• Idle mode: This mode is defined as one that a CPU can enter automatically when no threads are engaged,
and no high-speed devices are in use. CPU can be put into a power-gated state, but with L3 data retained,
DRAM, and bus clocks are reduced. Most of the internal logic is clock-gated; yet is still powered. In this
mode, all the external power from PMIC remains the same, and most IPs remain in their state. Therefore, the
interrupt response in this mode is quick compared to the Run mode.
• Suspend mode: This mode is defined as the most power-saving mode since it shuts off all the clocks and all
the unnecessary power supplies. In this mode, the Cortex-A55 CPU is fully power gated, all internal digital
logic, and the analog circuits that can be powered down are off, and all PHYs are power gated. VDD_SOC
(and related digital supply) voltage is reduced to the "Suspend mode" voltage. Compared to Idle, this mode
takes a longer time to exit, but it also uses far less energy.
• BBSM mode: This mode is also called RTC mode. In this mode, to keep RTC and BBSM logic alive, only the
power for the BBSM domain remains on.
• Off mode: In this mode, all power rails are off.

4.2.1 Low-power modes
Table 4 defines the state of each module in the Idle mode, Suspend mode, and BBSM mode.

6.1 Core benchmark use cases
The following use cases scenarios have been tested with Cortex A55 cores:
• Dhrystone
• CoreMark

6.1.1 Dhrystone
Dhrystone is a synthetic benchmark used to measure the integer computational performance of processors and
compilers. The small size of the Dhrystone benchmark enables it to fit into the L1 cache and minimizes access
to the L2 cache and DDR.
In this use case, the two Cortex-A55 cores perform the Dhrystone test. Because Dhrystone is a single thread
benchmark, two instances have been started. All Cortex-A55 cores run the test in a loop at a frequency of 1.7
GHz.
When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:
1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The display is OFF.
4. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.
To measure the power consumption of Dhrystone, the steps are as follows:
1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh, see Section 8.
3. Run dhrystone_loop.sh:
while [ "1" == "1" ]; do
taskset -c 0 ./dhry2 &
taskset -c 1 ./dhry2
done

4. Measure the power and record the results.
Table 8 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.

6.9.4 Smart doorbell
For this use case, a doorbell is simulated with a camera. The video stream collected on the doorbell can be sent
to other devices through the network. The AP1302 MIPI camera is used to record the video. The video is 480
p, encoded in H.264 format, and then the RTP protocol transfers the video. On the host PC, video playback
software VLC helps to open the session description protocol (SDP) file. By opening the file, the stream video
can be viewed.
When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:
1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.
To measure the power consumption of the smart doorbell, the steps are as follows:
1. Download the ap1302 firmware from ONSemiconductor, and rename it as ap1302.fw.
2. Copy ap1302.fw to the target board under the path /lib/firmware/imx/camera/.

7 Reducing power consumption
The overall system power consumption depends on the software optimization and the system hardware
implementation. The following list of suggestions can help reduce system power consumption. Some of these
suggestions are already implemented in the Linux BSP and/or SDK. The system of each individual user can
undergo further optimizations.
Note: Further power optimizations are planned in future software releases. To obtain the latest software
releases, refer i.MX Software and Development Tools.
• Apply clock gating by configuring registers in the CCM, whenever clocks or modules are not used.
• For Run modes, use the slowest frequency that can still meet the application requirements.

i.MX 93 Power Consumption Measurement
• Minimize the number of operating PLLs. Enabled PLLs can consume a few milliamps of current.
• Applying voltage and frequency scaling (VFS) for the Arm cores and scaling the frequencies of the AXI,
AHB, and IPG bus clocks can significantly reduce power consumption. However, the operation frequency
reduction causes longer access times to the DDR, which increases the power consumption of the DDR I/O
and memories. Consider this trade-off for each mode to quantify the overall effect on system power.
• Put the SoC into Low-power modes whenever possible, as long as it can still support the application
requirements. Consider the following example:
– Put the system into Suspend mode when it can enter deep sleep.
– Put the system into Low-power run mode by only using the CM33 core.
– Power off the CA55 cores and other domains for low-load use cases.
• For each operating mode, use the lowest voltage (with the power supply tolerance) that can still meet the
requirements of voltage specifications in the data sheet.
• DDR interface optimization:
– Use careful board routing of the DDR memories, maintaining PCB trace lengths as short as possible.
– Use the proper output driver impedance for DDR interface pins that provides good impedance matching.
To save current through DDR I/O pins, select the lowest possible drive strength that provides the required
performance.
– Use of LPDDR4/LPDDR4x memory offerings in the latest process technology can significantly reduce the
power consumption of the DDR devices and the DDR I/O.
The following sections provide more details for system optimization. These sections are not exhaustive lists of
features that can provide power reductions, but they are the easiest and most common ones.
• Run fast and idle
• Clock gating
• DDRC auto clock gating
• PLL reduction
• Core VFS and system bus scaling
• Lower DDR frequencies
• DDR interface optimization
• Power gating of PHYs
• Distribution of workloads
• Use OCRAM to minimize DDR access
• Thermal management to reduce leakage
• Nominal drive mode

7.1 Run fast and idle
NXP testing and various research have shown that for most customer use cases, the best power/energy
management protocol is to run the cores at maximum speeds for the workload and then drop to the lowest
power mode as soon as possible. This strategy cannot provide optimal energy savings for the use cases where
constant data is being processed, for example, low-latency audio playback. However, this strategy does work
for other standard workloads. Consider this trade-off for each application to quantify the overall effect on the
system power/energy consumption.
Users must place the i.MX 93 into the Low-power mode as far as possible.

7.2 Clock gating
The CCM inside the i.MX 93 provides a programmable method to disable the clock sources for modules when
the modules are not used. To reduce energy waste, always configure the CCM registers. Driving any inactive

NXP Semiconductors

i.MX 93 Power Consumption Measurement
signal, whether on the SoC or the PCB, is simply charging and discharging the line and the load capacitance of
this signal. The NXP BSP-released software implements clock gating by default.

7.3 DDRC auto clock gating
When the bus is idle after the number of cycles configured in the ssi_idle_strap field in the DDR
BLK_CTRL module, the DDRC does auto clock gating to save power. This feature can be used to balance DDR
subsystem performance and power significantly. The number of idle cycles before clock gating can be adjusted
dynamically based on the actual use case to fine-tune the power saving.
In the i.MX 93, auto_clk_gating is used to enable the DDRC auto clock gating. Therefore, power is saved when
there is no access to the DDR after the programmed idle count expires. "Write 0" disables the auto clock gating
and the "write non-zero" value sets the ssi_idle_strip to this non-zero value and enable the auto clock
gating. A value < 256 has some significant side effort for DDR performance, so a value >=256 is suggested
when the user wants to enable it. When the auto clock gating is enabled, a high-resolution display like 1080
P 60 fps can flicker at lower DDR frequency. It is recommended not to adjust the auto_clk_gating when the
display/NPU is running.

7.4 PLL reduction
Each PLL block consumes significant energy when active. Each application has unique requirements, but, if
possible, reduce the number of operating PLLs. The CCM within the i.MX 93 provides Root Clock mux and
programmable control to each PLL either by direct control mode or CPU Low-power mode. As a result, the
Root Clocks source is allowed to modify to limit the PLL source and reduce the number of active PLLs when
operating. Ensure that the application considers the PLL relock time when transitioning back to full operation.

7.5 Core VFS and system bus scaling
Applying VFS for the Arm cores and scaling (not dynamic) the frequencies of the NOC, AXI, AHB, and IPG
system bus clocks can significantly reduce the power consumption of the VDD_SOC domains. However, the
operation of system frequency reduction causes longer access times to the DDR, which can increase the
energy consumption for specific use cases. Consider this trade-off for each mode to quantify the overall effect
on the system power consumption.

7.6 Lower DDR frequencies
As explained previously, the DDR I/O bus frequency also contributes to the DDR I/O current. Software
interfaces allow for the use of the HWFFC/SWFFC technology of DDRC, which allows for the significant
reduction of power consumption by lowering the DDR frequency.

7.7 DDR interface optimization
To optimize the DDR interface, the suggestions are as follows:
• Employ careful board routing of the DDR memories, maintaining the PCB trace lengths as short as possible.
Longer trace lengths and more vias create more PCB capacitance for the signal, resulting in more energy
wastage along the signal path.
• Keep the on-die termination (ODT) value as low as possible. The termination used greatly influences the
power consumption of the DDR interface pins. To ensure the ODT variance does not reduce the bus signal
integrity, simulate the DDR interface.
• Use an appropriate output driver impedance for the DDR interface pins that provide good impedance
matching. Select the lowest possible drive strength that provides the required performance to reduce the
current flowing through the DDR I/O pins. Remember that simulation must be done to ensure signal integrity.

i.MX 93 Power Consumption Measurement
• The use of the DDR memory offerings in the latest process technology can significantly reduce the power
consumption of the DDR devices and the DDR I/O.
• Sizing DDR memory is important. If you select 4 GB memory when only 2 GB is used, you are wasting the
refresh current for the unused 2 GB of DDR.
• Sizing of ECC DDR regions is important as they use more energy for this feature.

7.8 Power gating of PHYs
The PHYs of unused modules often get overlooked when searching for power savings. Many PHYs contain
local PLLs or clocking circuits and voltage references, which consume power even when not in use. As a result,
high-speed PHYs like Ethernet, MIPI, and USB get affected.

7.9 Distribution of workloads
The concept of distributed workloads is to review the system requirements and determine which SoC block
is best suited for each task. By spreading the workload, the system can return to the "Idle" state sooner. This
process applies to multicore distributions and functions that suit the CM33 core or ML engine. System designers
must ensure that the design uses the optimal cores for the specific workloads or tasks, on the i.MX 93 for
maximum efficiency. While often easier said than done, it does provide significant power savings if the system
can return to the low-power state faster (run fast and idle).

7.10 Use OCRAM to minimize DDR access
To achieve significant power savings, load highly accessed code into the On-Chip RAM (OCRAM). As a result,
both the i.MX 93 and the DDR memory current consumption reduces. Another advantage of using the OCRAM
is a performance increase since DDR memory access time delays this code.

7.11 Thermal management to reduce leakage
Thermal management is also a key element of power reduction. As temperature increases, so does the SoC
gate leakage current for each gate within the device. Millions of high-gate leakages add up when looking for the
lowest power consumption. As explained earlier, with any power savings, the temperature of the SoC reduces,
and the lifetime reliability of the device improves.
As each system is unique, the system designer must ensure that the operating temperature of the SoC is as low
as possible to reduce the leakage current loss. If this temperature cannot be achieved from software controls,
the designer must include a heat sink or other thermal management methods to remove the heat from the SoC.

7.12 Nominal drive mode
The NXP-supplied Linux BSP GA release configures the system to run in Overdrive mode (ODM) by default.
This Overdrive mode and associated performance are not necessary for some user applications. Users can
transition to Nominal or Low-drive mode as defined in the i.MX 93 data sheet instead.

8 Important commands
Before running a use case, the <configuration_script>.sh script must be run to configure the
environment. Details for these scripts are as follows:
• setup.sh: The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz to achieve the best performance.
Disable the Ethernet, stop the Weston service, and blank the display. Set 512 kB as the maximum amount of
data the kernel reads ahead for a single file.
