# Foundries.io Secure Boot Implementation Investigation

**Issue Created:** October 5, 2025  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Security & Production Readiness  
**Status:** Open  

## üéØ **Objective**

Investigate and implement secure boot configuration for Foundries.io production builds to enable:
- Hardware-verified boot chain using EdgeLock Enclave (ELE)
- Signed bootloader, kernel, and OTA updates
- Production-ready security posture for deployed devices
- Compliance with security standards and best practices

## üîç **Current State Analysis**

### **Development Build Configuration (Current):**
```yaml
# ALL SIGNING DISABLED for development builds
SIGN_ENABLE = "0"
UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE = "0" 
UBOOT_SPL_SIGN_ENABLE = "0"
TF_A_SIGN_ENABLE = "0"
UEFI_SIGN_ENABLE = "0"
OPTEE_TA_SIGN_ENABLE = "0"
```

### **Infrastructure Ready but Unused:**
- ‚úÖ Complete signing key infrastructure configured
- ‚úÖ EdgeLock Enclave (ELE) hardware security module operational
- ‚úÖ Factory keys directory structure defined
- ‚úÖ LmP signing classes and recipes implemented
- ‚ùå Production keys not generated/deployed
- ‚ùå Secure boot chain not enabled

## üìã **Investigation Tasks**

### **Phase 1: Security Infrastructure Assessment**
- [ ] **Audit current ELE configuration and capabilities**
  - Verify ELE hardware security features available
  - Document ELE-based secure storage and crypto services
  - Test ELE functionality with current firmware

- [ ] **Review Foundries.io LmP security framework**
  - Analyze meta-lmp security classes and recipes
  - Document signing workflow and key management
  - Identify production vs development build differences

- [ ] **Assess factory key requirements**
  - Document required key types and formats
  - Define key generation and storage procedures
  - Plan secure key distribution workflow

### **Phase 2: Secure Boot Implementation**
- [ ] **Generate production signing keys**
  - Create RSA/ECDSA key pairs for each component
  - Implement secure key storage (HSM/secure enclave)
  - Document key backup and recovery procedures

- [ ] **Enable secure boot chain**
  - Configure U-Boot SPL signature verification
  - Enable TF-A trusted boot
  - Implement kernel module signing
  - Configure OP-TEE TA signing

- [ ] **Implement OTA security**
  - Enable signed OTA update verification
  - Configure secure update rollback protection
  - Test update integrity verification

### **Phase 3: Validation & Testing**
- [ ] **Security validation testing**
  - Verify boot chain signature verification
  - Test tamper detection and response
  - Validate secure update mechanisms

- [ ] **Performance impact assessment**
  - Measure boot time impact of signature verification
  - Assess runtime security overhead
  - Document power consumption impact

- [ ] **Compliance verification**
  - Verify CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) compliance
  - Document security features and capabilities
  - Prepare security certification materials

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Required Configuration Changes:**
```bash
# Production build configuration (to be implemented)
SIGN_ENABLE = "1"
UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE = "1"
UBOOT_SPL_SIGN_ENABLE = "1"
TF_A_SIGN_ENABLE = "1"
OPTEE_TA_SIGN_ENABLE = "1"

# Production key paths
MODSIGN_PRIVKEY = "${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/privkey_modsign.pem"
UBOOT_SIGN_KEYDIR = "${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys"
UBOOT_SPL_SIGN_KEYDIR = "${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys"
TF_A_SIGN_KEY_PATH = "${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/tf-a/privkey_ec_prime256v1.pem"
OPTEE_TA_SIGN_KEY = "${TOPDIR}/conf/factory-keys/opteedev.key"
```

### **EdgeLock Enclave Integration:**
- **Hardware Root of Trust:** ELE provides tamper-resistant security foundation
- **Secure Key Storage:** Production keys stored in ELE secure storage
- **Attestation:** Boot process attestation via ELE
- **OTA Verification:** Update signature verification using ELE crypto

## üö® **Security Considerations**

### **Key Management:**
- Production keys must never exist in development repositories
- Implement secure key generation and distribution
- Plan key rotation and revocation procedures
- Consider Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration

### **Attack Surface Reduction:**
- Disable debug interfaces in production builds
- Remove development tools and backdoors
- Implement secure boot failure handling
- Configure tamper detection and response

### **Compliance Requirements:**
- CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) compliance mandatory
- Security update capability required
- Vulnerability management procedures needed
- Secure development lifecycle documentation

## üìä **Success Criteria**

- [ ] **Secure boot chain fully operational**
- [ ] **All bootloader components signed and verified**
- [ ] **OTA updates cryptographically verified**
- [ ] **ELE hardware security features utilized**
- [ ] **Boot time impact < 2 seconds additional**
- [ ] **Power consumption impact < 5% increase**
- [ ] **CRA compliance documented and verified**

## üîó **Related Issues**

- **ELE Configuration:** Fixed in Build 2110 (critical for secure boot foundation)
- **Docker Service Investigation:** May impact OTA update security
- **Power Optimization:** Security overhead must be considered in power budget

## üìù **Notes**

- **Current Priority:** Medium-High (foundation ready, implementation needed)
- **Dependency:** ELE hardware functionality (now operational)
- **Timeline:** Target for production deployment readiness
- **Stakeholders:** Security team, hardware team, production engineering

## üîÑ **Status Updates**

**2025-10-05:** Issue created, ELE foundation operational in Build 2110  
**Next Review:** After Build 2110 validation and power optimization completion
