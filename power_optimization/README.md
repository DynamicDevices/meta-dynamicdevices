# E-Ink Board Power Optimization Results

## Overview
This folder contains comprehensive power consumption analysis for the imx93-jaguar-eink board, targeting 5-year battery life optimization.

## Current Status - Build 2082 Baseline

### Key Metrics
- **Average Current:** 243.0 mA (**Normal Operation - NOT Sleep Mode**)
- **Average Power:** 1.458 W  
- **Power Stability:** Excellent (1.2% coefficient of variation)
- **Battery Life (40Ah):** 0.02 years (7.3 days)
- **Optimization Required:** 99.6% power reduction needed for 5-year target

### Important Notes
- **This baseline represents normal operational power consumption**
- **Sleep mode optimization has NOT been implemented yet**
- **Significant power savings expected once sleep modes are properly configured**
- **Current consumption includes all active systems (WiFi, CPU, peripherals)**

### Test Details
- **Date:** 2025-10-04 16:37-16:42
- **Duration:** 5.4 minutes
- **Samples:** 22 measurements
- **Interval:** 10 seconds
- **Board Image:** imx93-jaguar-eink-lmp-2082

## Power Optimization Targets

| Target | Current (mA) | Power (W) | Battery Life (40Ah) | Reduction Required | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Current Build 2082** | 243.0 | 1.458 | 7.3 days | 0% (baseline) | Normal operation |
| **With Sleep Mode** | ~10-50 | ~0.06-0.30 | 1-4 months | 80-95% | Expected with proper sleep |
| **Optimized Sleep** | ~1-5 | ~0.006-0.03 | 8-40 months | 98-99% | Deep sleep + optimizations |
| **5-Year Target** | 0.9 | 0.005 | 5.0 years | **99.6%** | Ultimate goal |

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Build 2097** - Contains initial power optimizations:
   - i.MX93 Low Power Management (CONFIG_IMX93_LPM=y)
   - Filesystem optimizations (noatime, commit=60)
   - VM swappiness optimization (10 instead of 60)

2. **Implement Sleep Modes** - Major power reduction opportunity:
   - Deep sleep states during idle periods
   - Wake-on-network for image updates
   - CPU frequency scaling
   - Peripheral power gating

3. **Measure Build 2097** - Run identical 5-minute power test

4. **Compare Results** - Generate comparison charts showing optimization impact

5. **Iterate** - Continue optimization based on results
