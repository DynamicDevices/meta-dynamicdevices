cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdX encrypted_data

# Configuration file encryption
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --symmetric config.json
```

**Data in Transit**:
- TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- Certificate-based authentication
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) required

**Key Management**:
- Hardware security module (EdgeLock Enclave) for key storage
- Regular key rotation procedures
- Secure key derivation and distribution

### 4.2 Access Controls

**Authentication**:
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- Certificate-based device authentication
- Regular credential rotation

**Authorization**:

- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and audits

**Audit Logging**:
```bash
# System access logging
journalctl -u ssh -f | grep "Accepted\|Failed"

# File access monitoring
auditctl -w /etc/sensitive/ -p wa -k sensitive_access
```

### 4.3 Data Retention and Disposal

**Retention Schedules**:
- System logs: 90 days
- Diagnostic data: 30 days
- Configuration backups: 1 year
- Security logs: 2 years

**Secure Disposal**:
```bash
# Secure file deletion
shred -vfz -n 3 sensitive_file.txt

# Full disk sanitization
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=1M
```
