# Issue 1: TODO Comments Need Resolution
gh issue create \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Resolve Outstanding TODO Comments in Codebase" \
  --label "code-quality,maintenance,cleanup" \
  --body "## Description
Multiple TODO comments throughout the codebase need attention and resolution.

## Identified TODOs requiring action:

### High Priority
- **SPI Library C++ Warnings**: \`recipes-bsp/spi-lib/spi-lib_git.bb\` has C++11 narrowing conversion warnings being suppressed instead of fixed
- **Device Tree Organization**: Multiple device trees have \"TODO: Break these out better?\" for pinctrl organization
- **OPTEE Signing Keys**: Multiple build scripts reference missing signing key configuration
- **SE05X Configuration**: Machine configs have TODO about SE05X_OEFID not taking effect

### Medium Priority  
- **Web Browser Provisioning**: WiFi onboarding documentation mentions unimplemented web browser support
- **Audio Production**: Pipeline needs TODO for disabling production WiFi connection
- **Radar SDK QA Issues**: Recipe skips QA checks instead of addressing root cause
- **Meson Build Issues**: Contains patches with \"FIXME: Add all features\" comments

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review each TODO comment for continued relevance
- [ ] Create specific issues for complex TODOs requiring substantial work
- [ ] Fix or remove simple TODOs that can be addressed directly
- [ ] Update documentation where TODOs reference outdated information

## Priority
Medium - Code quality and technical debt reduction"

# Issue 2: Recipe License Information Cleanup
gh issue create \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Fix Recipe License Information - CLOSED Licenses Need Resolution" \
  --label "legal,code-quality,recipes" \
  --body "## Description
Several recipes have incorrect or incomplete license information that needs to be resolved.

## Problematic Recipes

### LICENSE = \"CLOSED\" Issues
- \`recipes-bsp/upd72020x-load/upd72020x-load_git.bb\` - Set to CLOSED with empty LIC_FILES_CHKSUM
- \`recipes-connectivity/uwb-mqtt-publisher/uwb-mqtt-publisher_1.0.bb\` - CLOSED license with empty checksum  
- \`recipes-config/phasora-config/phasora-config_1.0.bb\` - CLOSED license

### Warning Comments About License Guesses
- \`recipes-devtools/python/python3-*.bb\` files contain \"WARNING: the following LICENSE and LIC_FILES_CHKSUM values are best guesses\"
- \`recipes-bsp/radar-sdk/radar-sdk_git.bb\` has similar warning

## Resolution Required
1. **Determine actual licenses** for each component by examining source code headers
2. **Replace CLOSED licenses** with appropriate open source or commercial licenses
3. **Add proper LIC_FILES_CHKSUM** values pointing to actual license files
4. **Remove warning comments** once licenses are verified

## Legal Compliance
Using CLOSED licenses should only be for truly proprietary components. Most components likely have identifiable open source licenses.

## Priority
High - Legal compliance and proper attribution required"

# Issue 3: QA Check Failures and INSANE_SKIP Usage
gh issue create \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Address QA Check Failures Instead of Using INSANE_SKIP" \
  --label "code-quality,build-system,qa" \
  --body "## Description
Multiple recipes use INSANE_SKIP to bypass QA checks instead of addressing the underlying issues.

## Problematic Uses

### Development Dependencies
- \`recipes-bsp/spi-lib/spi-lib_git.bb\`: \`INSANE_SKIP = \"dev-deps dev-elf\"\`
- \`recipes-multimedia/nxp-afe/nxp-afe_git.bb\`: \`INSANE_SKIP += \"dev-so\"\`
- \`recipes-multimedia/nxp-afe/nxp-afe-voiceseeker_git.bb\`: \`INSANE_SKIP += \"dev-so\"\`

### Architecture Issues  
- \`recipes-support/waydroid/waydroid-data.bb\`: \`INSANE_SKIP += \"arch file-rdeps\"\`
- \`recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/gstreamer1.0-plugins-good_1.24.0.imx.bb\`: \`INSANE_SKIP += \"32bit-time\"\`

### Commented Out Issues
- \`recipes-kernel/firmware-imx/firmware-imx_%.bbappend\`: Has commented INSANE_SKIP for ldflags

## Recommended Actions
1. **Investigate root causes** of each QA failure
2. **Fix packaging issues** instead of skipping checks where possible
3. **Document justification** for any remaining INSANE_SKIP usage
4. **Review commented skips** to determine if they're still needed

## Benefits
- Improved package quality and compliance
- Better error detection during builds
- Cleaner, more maintainable recipes

## Priority
Medium - Code quality improvement"

# Issue 4: STUSB4500 Power Controller Missing Device Tree Implementation
gh issue create \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "STUSB4500 Power Controller Device Tree Implementation Missing" \
  --label "hardware,device-tree,enhancement" \
  --body "## Description
The STUSB4500 USB-C power delivery controller is documented in Edge AI Board wiki but missing from device tree implementation.

## Current State
- **Wiki Documentation**: Pins documented as SAI2_RXFS_GPIO4_IO21 (USB_ALERT#), SAI1_TXC_GPIO4_IO11 (USB_RESET)
- **Device Tree**: \`imx8mm-jaguar-sentai.dts\` has no STUSB4500 configuration
- **Hardware**: Support exists but software integration incomplete

## Expected Implementation
- Device tree entry for STUSB4500 on I2C1 bus
- Pin configurations matching hardware design:
  - USB_ALERT# on GPIO4_IO21 (MX8MM_IOMUXC_SAI2_RXFS_GPIO4_IO21)  
  - USB_RESET on GPIO4_IO11 (MX8MM_IOMUXC_SAI1_TXC_GPIO4_IO11)
- Driver integration for USB-C PD functionality

## Files to Update
- \`recipes-bsp/device-tree/lmp-device-tree/imx8mm-jaguar-sentai.dts\`
- Potentially kernel config for STUSB4500 driver support
- May need I2C1 bus configuration updates

## Hardware Reference
See [Edge AI Board Wiki](https://github.com/DynamicDevices/meta-dynamicdevices/wiki/Edge-AI-Board#power-management-stusb4500-interface-i2c1) for complete pin mapping.

## Priority
High - Hardware feature not accessible without proper device tree configuration"

# Issue 5: Device Tree Pinctrl Organization Needs Improvement
gh issue create \
  --repo "$REPO" \
  --title "Device Tree Pinctrl Configuration Organization Cleanup" \
  --label "device-tree,code-quality,maintenance" \
  --body "## Description
Multiple device tree files have TODO comments about improving pinctrl organization, indicating current structure needs cleanup.

## Affected Files
- \`imx8mm-jaguar-sentai.dts\`: \"TODO: Break these out better?\" in pinctrl_hog
- \`imx8mm-jaguar-handheld.dts\`: Same organizational issue
- Other device trees may have similar issues

## Current Problems
- Overly large \`pinctrl_hog\` groups mixing unrelated pin functions
- Pin configurations not logically grouped by peripheral/function
- Harder to maintain and understand pin assignments

## Proposed Improvements
1. **Separate pinctrl groups** by functional area:
   - \`pinctrl_wifi_bt\`: Wireless connectivity pins
   - \`pinctrl_sensors\`: Sensor interface pins  
   - \`pinctrl_audio\`: Audio codec pins
   - \`pinctrl_power\`: Power management pins
   - \`pinctrl_leds\`: LED control pins

2. **Assign specific groups** to their respective device nodes instead of using hog

3. **Add descriptive comments** for each pin group's purpose

## Benefits
- Improved maintainability and readability
- Easier to debug pin configuration issues
- Better organization for future hardware variants
- Follows device tree best practices

## Priority
Medium - Code quality and maintainability improvement"
