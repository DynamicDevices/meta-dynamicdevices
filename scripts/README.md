## üîß Board Programming & Deployment

### `fio-program-board.sh` / `fio-program-board.bat`
**Purpose:** Downloads Foundries.io target builds and programs Dynamic Devices boards.

**Features:**
- Interactive configuration setup for factory and machine defaults
- Comprehensive fioctl authentication checking
- Downloads all required programming artifacts (wic.gz, bootloaders, U-Boot images)
- Generates ready-to-use programming scripts
- Automatic board programming with `--program` flag
- Custom boot files support with `--mfgfolder` option
- Intelligent caching to avoid re-downloading existing files
- Comprehensive timing for download and programming performance tracking
- Support for all Dynamic Devices board types
- Cross-platform support (Linux/Windows)

**Usage:**
```bash
# First time setup (interactive configuration)
./scripts/fio-program-board.sh --configure

# Download and program board automatically
./scripts/fio-program-board.sh --program

# Download specific target and program
./scripts/fio-program-board.sh 1451 --program

# Override factory and machine
./scripts/fio-program-board.sh --factory my-factory --machine imx8mm-jaguar-sentai 1451

# Program imx8mm-jaguar-sentai with custom boot files (RECOMMENDED)
./scripts/fio-program-board.sh --factory sentai --machine imx8mm-jaguar-sentai --program --mfgfolder program

# Use custom boot files from relative path
./scripts/fio-program-board.sh --factory sentai --machine imx8mm-jaguar-sentai --program --mfgfolder ./custom-boot-files

# List available targets
./scripts/fio-program-board.sh --factory my-factory --list-targets
```

**Custom Boot Files (--mfgfolder option):**

The `--mfgfolder` option allows you to specify a custom directory containing `imx-boot-mfgtool` and `u-boot-mfgtool.itb` files. This is particularly useful for:

- **Board-specific optimizations**: Using custom bootloader configurations
- **Development testing**: Testing new bootloader versions
- **Recovery scenarios**: Using known-good bootloader files

**How it works:**
1. The script copies your custom boot files to the extracted mfgtool-files directory
2. The original UUU scripts run unchanged, but now use your custom files
3. Relative paths are resolved relative to your current working directory

**Example structure:**
```
program/                          # Custom boot files directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ imx-boot-mfgtool             # Custom manufacturing bootloader
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ u-boot-mfgtool.itb           # Custom manufacturing U-Boot
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uuu                          # (Optional) UUU executable
```

### `program-local-build.sh`
**Purpose:** Programs a board using UUU (Universal Update Utility) with locally built images.

**Features:**
- Uses locally built mfgtool-files and UUU scripts
- Custom boot firmware support with `--mfgfolder` option
- Automatic file validation and linking
- Clean temporary file handling

**Usage:**
```bash
# Program board with locally built image
./scripts/program-local-build.sh --machine imx8mm-jaguar-sentai

# Use custom boot firmware files (files used directly, not copied)
./scripts/program-local-build.sh --machine imx8mm-jaguar-sentai --mfgfolder /path/to/custom/boot/files

# Use custom boot files from relative path
./scripts/program-local-build.sh --machine imx8mm-jaguar-sentai --mfgfolder ./custom-boot-files
```

**Custom Boot Files (--mfgfolder option):**

The `--mfgfolder` option allows you to specify a custom directory containing `imx-boot-mfgtool` and `u-boot-mfgtool.itb` files. This is particularly useful for:

- **Board-specific optimizations**: Using custom bootloader configurations
- **Development testing**: Testing new bootloader versions  
- **Recovery scenarios**: Using known-good bootloader files

**How it works:**
1. The script validates your custom folder contains the required files
2. Creates temporary symbolic links to your custom files with unique names
3. Generates a temporary UUU script that references these custom files
4. Runs UUU with the temporary script using your custom boot firmware
5. Cleans up all temporary files after programming completes

**Example structure:**
```
custom-boot-files/               # Custom boot files directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ imx-boot-mfgtool            # Custom manufacturing bootloader
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ u-boot-mfgtool.itb          # Custom manufacturing U-Boot
```
